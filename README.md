# Sine Function Implementation using Taylor Series

This project demonstrates the implementation of the sine function using the Taylor series approximation. The code is written in C for the 8051 MCU and includes interaction with a keyboard and LCD screen. The hardware design for the calculator is simulated using Proteus v8.11 software.

## Features

- Calculates the sine of an angle in radians using a Taylor series approximation.
- User interaction through a keyboard and LCD screen.
- ANS button displays the calculated value.
- ON/C button clears the calculated value.
